- This [worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ACInZjybHO91J53p1HrEaPxn8wKxdPAppkET2UgFlZw/edit?usp=sharing) contains a detailed list of all **GRIHA parameters** that need to be validated once relevant documents are uploaded.  
- We conducted a **preliminary assessment** to determine which parameters can be **automated** and identified some of the key documents required for the automation process. These findings are also included in the worksheet.
