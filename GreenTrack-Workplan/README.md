## **Automation Workflow for GreenTrack Certification**  

- This [worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ACInZjybHO91J53p1HrEaPxn8wKxdPAppkET2UgFlZw/edit?usp=sharing) contains a detailed list of all **GRIHA parameters** that need to be validated once relevant documents are uploaded.  
- We conducted a **preliminary assessment** to determine which parameters can be **automated** and identified some of the key documents required for the automation process. These findings are also included in the worksheet.  
- Post the feasability assessment we settled on **energy efficency** and **sustainable site planning** as criterions to focus on and build parameter based microsolutions for. This lead to the development of both the **Proximity Evaluator** and **Energy Rating Evaluator**.
- Currently the team is team is working on building out the site plan analsyer tool that would automate the reading and analysis of architectural drawings. The various components of the site plan analyser tool can be found in this [Site Plan Analyser - Components doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12YulJZl-Ff983njL5aunBDDPWTWPGwbThdJLLEb0F-M/edit?usp=sharing).
