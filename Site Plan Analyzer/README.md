# **Site Plan Analyzer**
[PLACEHOLDER: introduction]


## **Modules Overview**  
The **Site Plan Analyzer** is divided into several **modules** to simplify the analysis process. Each module focuses on specific aspects of the site plan, ensuring that all critical parameters are covered.

| **Module**                     | **Purpose**                                      | **Sub-Components**                                     | **AI Tasks**                                          |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Boundaries and Site Layout**  | Define property limits and building layout.      | - Site Boundary Lines <br> - Building Footprint <br> - Setbacks | Identify perimeter lines, footprints, and setbacks. |
| **Dimensions and Measurements** | Ensure accuracy of size and layout.              | - Dimension Lines <br> - Scale                        | Extract numerical measurements and interpret scales. |
| **Structural Elements**         | Identify access points and building structure.  | - Doors <br> - Windows <br> - Walls                   | Detect arcs and lines representing openings and walls. |
| **Landscape & Environmental Features** | Monitor green infrastructure and elevation. | - Trees <br> - Vegetation <br> - Contours <br> - Paved Areas | Identify trees, contours, and paved surfaces. |
| **Utility and Service Lines**   | Verify placement of essential utilities.        | - Water Supply <br> - Electrical Lines                | Recognize utility lines and poles with labels. |
| **Annotations and Labels**      | Extract relevant information from plans.        | - Text Labels <br> - North Arrow                      | Use OCR to detect annotations and plan orientation. |
| **Non-Motorized Transport (NMT)** | Ensure sustainable transport infrastructure. | - Bicycle Parking <br> - Footpaths <br> - EV Charging Infrastructure | Identify symbols and spaces for NMT facilities. |
| **Environmental Monitoring**    | Track and assess environmental parameters over time. | - Solar Capacity <br> - Wind Flow <br> - Air/Soil Pollution | Monitor trends using IoT devices and environmental data. |
