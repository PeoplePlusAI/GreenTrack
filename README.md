## **Introduction**  

Project GreenTrack aims to create a stack of **AI-powered solutions** to **automate and streamline the process of green building certification**. This tool leverages **artificial intelligence** to validate and verify key parameters outlined under green building rating standards, beginning with Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment [(GRIHA Standards)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ACInZjybHO91J53p1HrEaPxn8wKxdPAppkET2UgFlZw/edit?usp=sharing). The aim is to make the process more faster, efficient, and affordable.

### **Our Goals**  
1. **Automate** the verification and validation of parameters within the **GRIHA framework**.  
2. **Demonstrate** the tool’s capabilities by automating select parameters—specifically focusing on **sustainable site planning** and **energy efficency** criterions.  
3. **Incentivize green buildings** by reducing the time, cost, and effort associated with certification, promoting wider adoption of sustainable built environments.


### **The Problem**  
The current green building certification process is:  
- **Effort-Intensive:** Requires significant human involvement to track compliance, complete and verify paperwork.
- **Lengthy:** Involves multiple stakeholders, extensive documentation, and manual assessments.  
- **Expensive:** High costs associated with consulting, auditing, and approvals.  

These challenges act as **barriers to adoption**, making it difficult for builders, developers, and organizations to commit to sustainable construction practices. As a result, the widespread implementation of **green buildings** has been limited.

### **The Solution: AI-Powered Certification**  

**GreenTrack** envisions a future where **AI transforms the green certification process** into a fast, efficent and cost-effective experience. Our tool aims to:  

1. **Automate Compliance Checks:** AI-driven tools to verify compliance with minimal manual effort.  
2. **Assist Stakeholders Seamlessly:** Support for builders, consultants, auditors, ULBs, and certification bodies to quickly verify and demonstrate compliance with **GRIHA standards**.  
3. **Promote Green Building Adoption:** By reducing certification costs and time, we encourage more developers to pursue sustainable construction.

## **GreenTrack Workplan**

### **Automation Workflow for GreenTrack Certification**  

- This [worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ACInZjybHO91J53p1HrEaPxn8wKxdPAppkET2UgFlZw/edit?usp=sharing) contains a detailed list of all **GRIHA parameters** that need to be validated once relevant documents are uploaded.  
- We conducted a **preliminary assessment** to determine which parameters can be **automated** and identified some of the key documents required for the automation process. These findings are also included in the worksheet.  

## **Getting Started**  

**[PLACEHOLDER]** Add instructions to run the tool locally.
