## **Introduction**  

Project GreenTrack aims to create a stack of **AI-powered solutions** to **automate and streamline the process of green building certification**. This tool leverages **LLMs** to validate and verify key parameters outlined under green building rating standards, beginning with Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment [(GRIHA Standards)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ACInZjybHO91J53p1HrEaPxn8wKxdPAppkET2UgFlZw/edit?usp=sharing). The aim is to make the process more faster, efficient, and affordable.

### **The Problem**  

The current green building certification process is:  
- **Effort-Intensive:** Requires significant human involvement to track compliance, complete and verify paperwork.
- **Lengthy:** Involves multiple stakeholders, extensive documentation, and manual assessments.  
- **Expensive:** High costs associated with consulting, auditing, and approvals.  

These challenges act as **barriers to adoption**, making it difficult for builders, developers, and organizations to commit to sustainable construction practices. As a result, the widespread implementation of **green buildings** has been limited.

### **The Solution: AI-Powered Certification**  

**GreenTrack** envisions a future where **AI transforms the green certification process** into a fast, efficent and cost-effective experience. Our tool aims to:  

1. **Automate Compliance Checks:** AI-driven tools to verify compliance with minimal manual effort.  
2. **Assist Stakeholders Seamlessly:** Support for builders, consultants, auditors, ULBs, and certification bodies to quickly verify and demonstrate compliance with **GRIHA standards**.  
3. **Promote Green Building Adoption:** By reducing certification costs and time, we encourage more developers to pursue sustainable construction.

## **Getting Started**  

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/PeoplePlusAI/GreenTrack.git
   ```

2. The source code for the individual prototypes can be found in these folders:  
   - [Energy Rating Evaluator](./Energy%20Rating%20Evaluator)  
   - [Proximity Evaluator](./Proximity%20Evaluator)  
   - [Site Plan Analyzer](./Site%20Plan%20Analyzer)  

3. Follow the instructions in the README.md for the tool to run it.
